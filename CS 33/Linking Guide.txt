Linking Guide:

1)To build the executable, the linker must perform two main tasks:

. Symbol resolution. Object files define and reference symbols. The purpose
of symbol resolution is to associate each symbol reference with exactly one
symbol definition.

. Relocation. Compilers and assemblers generate code and data sections that
start at address 0. The linker relocates these sections by associating a memory
location with each symbol definition, and then modifying all of the references
to those symbols so that they point to this memory location.
