Caveats:
1. if you perform a jmp instruction, record where the %rip points to 
2. If you access the stack memory in any way, record is as shown on the website
3. same when you access the memory using ()s
4. Sometimes we will jump out of data.c  
5. Single lines almost always have more than one machine instruction. Copy all of them only is there is no jump instruction in them. If there is, don;t copy the line from the jump instruction
6. To go back one step, use reverse-stepi
