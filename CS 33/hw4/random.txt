Homework 4

2.89)
A)
return (float) x == (float) ax;

This does not always yield 1. This is because casting the double ax onto a float can cause truncation of the decimal values beyond the accuracy of floats. So this statement doesn't always return 1


B)
return (dx -dy) == (double)(x-y);

Yes, this always returns 1 as double is large enough to store the numbers after the decimal point in a and b, which are integers.


C)
return (dx + dy) + dz == dx + (dy + dz);

Yes, this also always returns 1. Addition of doubles is assosicative. Adding them is different orders doesn't change the values.


D)
return (dx * dy) * dz == dx * (dy * dz);

Yes, this too always returns 1. Doubles might have limited accuracy (even though it is more accurate than floats and objectively very accurate), but the numbers that might get truncated will be the same 	 


E)
return dx/dx ==dz/dz

Not always true, because dividing doubles can lead to undefined results, for example when dx=0 or dz=0. That will output NaN, and NaN is undefined, and trying to equate them can throw an error.
