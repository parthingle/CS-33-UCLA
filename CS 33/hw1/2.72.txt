 A. size_t data type is an unsigned type of integer -- ie subtracting it from an integer will also return an unsigned int. This will leave out a possibility for it to overflow and return a positive value, which will clear the conditional statement, and hence return a wrong answer.  

B. To fix it, the conditional statement must be:

if (maxbytes >= sizeof (val)){
...
}

This way, only if the numeric valu
