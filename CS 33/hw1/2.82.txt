A) (x<y) == (-x>-y)

Always 1. It is so because x and y are both signed integers. ie the < and > comparative signed return the correct answers. Therefore, if x is less than y, -ve x is greater than -ve y

B) ( (x+y)<<4) +y-x == 17*y+15

Not always 1. For ex. if x=-2, and y=1:

LHS = ((-2+1) << 4) +1 - (-1) 
    =  (-16) +1 +1 = 14

RHS = 17*(1) + 15(-2) = -13

LHS=/=RHS
